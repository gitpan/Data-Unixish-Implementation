        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - use Tie::Diamond so that STDIN is really processed as stream.

        - Add Data::Unixish::Apply to apply one or more functions to Perl data.

        - New dux functions: sort (currently supporting -n, -i, -c)

        - By default setting env LOG=0 to speedup startup. Run with LOG=1 to
          enable logging.
